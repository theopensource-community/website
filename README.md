TheOpenSource.community project is founded to help provide resources to communities and individuals working within the open source space, to streamline the developer experience no matter your starting level of expertise, and to support contributions to each upstream project in a number of ways. 

We're only _just_ getting started on our journey; and so, more information on our current trajectory and where we're headed can be found in [the Roadmap](https://theopensource.community/projects/roadmap). 

Interested in contributing to this project? We need **your** help to support additional communities and realize a number of goals to aid both open source projects and interested contributors or end users, alike. Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information. Please adhere to this oroject's [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
